# About

I am a teacher for _A level Computer Science_.
This repository contains various notes, solutions and utilities that I have made to help me support the teaching.

Feel free to make use of them.  I loosely follow this [curriculum](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-international-as-and-a-level-computer-science-9608/) with several additional materials included.
